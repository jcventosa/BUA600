    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You have just been hired by a real estate company in San Francisco, California. They are trying to enter the short-term rental market by listing several of their properties on Airbnb.com and they have hired you to help inform their direction and marketing. You have a few questions about how Airbnb listings perform, based on factors such as: number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing Airbnb listings, what are the factors that go into a typical consumer decision-making process? Can we decompose this process by looking at the data? We can begin to estimate consumer interests by asking questions of the data, such as: How many bathrooms does the rental property have? It is a yurt, a cottage, or a mansion? How much is the nightly fee? What amenities are provided?\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to import raw data, clean the data, and provide insights to your real estate client, based on the available sample data and structured questions below. They are looking to you to provide programmatic insights based on your new Python skills!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Time to complete: 4-8 hours**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "This assignment will provide you with a chance to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read/write CSV files using Python's built-in `csv` module.\n",
    "1. Clean and transform raw data from a csv into `lists` and `dicts`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal is to filter the data and perform some basic analysis, looking to glean market insights and answer questions such as: \n",
    "\n",
    "- What is the most frequently offered amenity in San Francisco?\n",
    "- What is the average cost of listings that match a certain criteria?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through Pythonic data analysis in different stages: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Required:** This section covers classroom topics from Unit 1 and is _required_. \n",
    "- **Advanced:** This section covers upcoming topics from future Units and is _optional_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the notebook, you will see clearly labeled sections setting up questions for you to solve. _You must provide answers to all of the questions in the **Required** section._ Note that some questions have been further divided up into \"Part 1\", \"Part 2\", (etc) in order to break down the steps of sequential logic used in Python programming. Please attempt answers for all parts.\n",
    "\n",
    "For those of you who wish to work ahead or want to come back later for more practice, the **Advanced** section offers additional prompts that will extend your analysis. This section is optional; you do not need to complete these for submission. Depending on the discretion of your section instructor, these questions may be worth bonus points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the **Challenge** section provides an additional set of real-world prompts and examples that integrate new programming concepts and Python libraries not covered in this class. Challenge questions are intended to help you explore and continue your learning outside of this course! _You do not need to complete Challenge questions._\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open the assignment notebook. \n",
    "1. Save a copy of your notebook and retitle it: \"yourname_assignment.ipynb\"\n",
    "1. Attempt answers for all **Required questions**. Some questions can be solved in many different ways!\n",
    "1. Include at least one comment per question explaining your logic or approach. To include a comment in your Python code, use the `#` sign.\n",
    "1. Make sure to include all work within your Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "1. Submit answers for the **Required questions** to your instructional team by the due date.\n",
    "1. Have fun!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data \n",

    "[Our data](./data/sanfran_airbnb.csv) is a truncated subset of data taken from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com). You'll see twelve columns:\n",
